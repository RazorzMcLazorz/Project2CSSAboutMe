        My personal interests
      </h2>
      
      <p class="formatParagraph">
        I know this isn't like a hobby or anything but my career is a personal interest to me so here you go...
        I’m currently going to UVU for a bachelor’s in computer science, specifically focusing on
        full-stack development, which this meaning I get to know how to do all sides of
        programming, not just one.
        <br>
        This was not my original goal as I didn't actually want to go
        to college, I actually went to a coding Bootcamp called Bottega to learn how to program,
        and they taught me a bunch of languages, but the main languages, I use today is React.js,
        Javascript, CSS, SCSS, HTML, Node.js, Python, and a bunch more. The main thing I loved
        about the bootcamp is they didn’t just teach me the languages but they taught me how to teach myself.
        <br>
        I know college teaches this as well, but it takes longer, and I didnt want to go for the
        time requirement and the factor of will i make it? After bootcamp i found a position and learned there
        but I also found programming my own projects at the same time is a huge factor
        in my life, learning,and the enjoyment in creating things.
      </p>

      <p class="formatParagraph">
        I also love playing video games, I have played many games from RPG to MMO, and City builders.
        It depends on the gameplay to see if I like them. I have tried my hand at making video games
        and I hope to make a good one someday but none have been finished and that's a problem that
        I have suffered a lot from. I spend a lot of my gaming time playing with my wife, I'm so happy
        to find someone who enjoys playing games with me, and tries to get me to play games with her! 
      </p>

      <p class="formatParagraph">
        I also love taking care of my car, and I hope to one day own one of the Nissan Z generation cars.
        I love how they show the car off, and the design and sounds it makes. I'm not one who will die for
        it but it's more of a side interest.
      </p>
